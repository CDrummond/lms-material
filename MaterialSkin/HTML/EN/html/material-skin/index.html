<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>MaterialSkin is a (hopefully) simple HTML5 WebApp for LMS, featuring 2 main layouts:
  <ul>
    <li>Mobile</li>
    <li>Desktop</li>
  </ul>
By default the app will attempt to use the correct layout depending on the width of your current screen. However, you may use
'Settings -> Interface' to override this and force the usage of one or the other.
</p>
<p>This help page will provide some basic
information that will hopefully provide some useful detail on how to use this app.
</p>
<br/>

<h1>Mobile layout</h1>
<p>This layout is intended for use on mobile phones and small tablets. It contains a standard view selector at the bottom, allowing
the current view to change between:
  <ul>
    <li>Browse - allows browsing your local music collection, apps, radio, etc.</li>
    <li>Playing - shows information (e.g. title, cover, etc.) about the currently playing track.</li>
    <li>Queue - shows the list of currently queued tracks.</li>
  </ul>
You can navigate between views by either touching the relevant button at the bottom of the screen, or by swiping left/right.
If you are already on a view and you touch its button then the following will occur:
  <ul>
    <li>Browse - navigate one level back, i.e. this is the same as pressing the back button.</li>
    <li>Playing - will show artist, album, and track information if the 'Music and Artist Information' plugin is installed on your
    LMS system.</li>
    <li>Queue - scroll the play queue such that the current track is now visible.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<br/>

<h1>Desktop layout</h1>
<p>This layout is intended for devices with wide screens, such as laptops and desktop PCs. This layout displays the Browse view on
the left, the Queue on the right, and details of the current track along the bottom (if there are tracks in the queue). Pressing
the 'Expand now playing' button in the main toolbar will replace the Browse and Queue views with a single view showing large
cover-art and track details. Similarly clicking 'Showing current track information' (if the 'Music and Artist Information' plugin
is installed) will show a view containing artist, album, and track information (e.g. lyrics).
</p>
<br/>

<h1>Long-press</h1>
<p>There are various long-press features within the app. These allow accessing features by pressing an element for 1/2 a second or
more. The current long-press features are:
  <ul>
    <li>Browse bottom tab in mobile layout - if the app is already showing the Browse view, then a long press here navigates back
    'Home'.</li>
    <li>'Back' button in Browse view - navigate 'Home'.</li>
    <li>'Back' button in dialog headers (such as 'Player settings') - closes all dialogs.</li><li>Volume labels - mute/unmute.</li>
    <li>Play/pause buttons - shows the 'Sleep' dialog.</li>
    <li>'Repeat off' icon, or the DSTM (infinity) icon - show DSTM (Don't Stop the Music) options.</li>
    <li>Duration label in queue - shows the 'Transfer queue' dialog, if you have 2 or more players.</li>
    <li>Player icon in toolbar next to player name - shows the 'Synchronise' dialog, if you have 2 or more players.</li>
    <li>'Manage players' menu entry - shows the 'Synchronise' dialog, if you have 2 or more players.</li>
    <li>'Prev track' button - skips X seconds back, keep pressed for multiple skips. The exact skip duration is configurable.</li>
    <li>'Next track' button - skips X seconds forward, keep pressed for multiple skips. The exact skip duration is configurable.</li>
    <li>If you have plugin specific settings actions added to 'Player settings' then long-pressing on one of these will add the item
    to the 'Home' screen.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<br/>

<h1>Manage players</h1>
<p>If you have 2 or more players on your system, or have multiple instances of LMS, then there will be a 'Manage players' entry in
the menu that appears when you press on a player's name in the main toolbar. This will produce a dialog allowing you to see the
current state of all your players (current track, volume, etc). This dialog will allow you to:
  <ul>
    <li>List standard players, and 'Group' players. 'Group' players will only be shown if you have the 'Group Players' LMS plugin
    installed.</li>
    <li>Synchronise players. By dragging one player over another you can create a group of synchronised players. To remove a player
    from a group, drag the player onto the main toolbar (which should be displaying 'Drop here to remove from group').</li>
    <li>If you have the 'Group Players' LMS plugin installed, then you can use this dialog to create, edit, and delete such groups.
    This dialog has a menu button top right, and in there will be an action to create a group player.</li>
    <li>If you have multiple LMS instances on your network, then this dialog can be used to move players from another LMS instance
    onto the current one.</li>
    <li>Set a 'Default' player. If a player is marked as default, then it will be automatically selected when Material is restarted.
    If the 'Default' player is not visible at start-up, another will be used, but when the 'Default' player subsequently becomes
    visible it will be selected. To set a player as 'Default' use the menu button (three dots) at the far right of a player.</li>
  </ul>
The currently active player is indicated by a semi-transparent highlight. If a player is the 'Default' player it will have a tick
next to its name. Any players with an active sleep timer will also have a picture of a bed next to their name.
</p>
<br/>

<h1>Settings</h1>
<p>Due to LMS's nature, there are multiple settings dialogs.
  <ul>
    <li>Interface - contains settings to control the layout of the Material Skin interface. Any changes here are stored within the
    current browser, so are user-specific. To allow you to set default settings, in this dialog there is a menu button top right
    containing; 'Save as default' and 'Revert to default'. There are also Material Skin settings with the Server settings category -
    these settings will be shared for all users.</li>
    <li>Player - contains player specific settings, such as its name, alarms, etc. By default only a limited number of settings are
    shown, but LMS has may settings. To access all LMS settings for a player press the 'Extra settings' button near the bottom of
    this dialog. If your player is a piCorePlayer or SqueezeESP32 device, then this dialog will also contain a button allowing you
    to access the web-based configuration UI of those devices.</li>
    <li>Server - contains all the LMS server settings, e.g. for installing plugins, etc.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<br/>

<h1>Browse modes</h1>
<p>Usually with LMS the list of browse modes (e.g. Artists, Albums, Genres) is configured per-player. This is why in the 'Extra
settings' section of 'Player settings' there is a section named 'Additional Browse Modes.' However, as this app is designed to
control multiple players, the list of browse modes available for this app is not configured there but in 'Settings -> Interface'.
In that dialog you will see a set of checkboxes to configure which top-level categories are shown on the 'Home' screen. The 'My
Music' entry has a cog icon next to it. Pressing on this icon will produce a dialog allowing you to configure which browse modes
will be shown with this app.
</p>
<br/>

<h1>Virtual libraries</h1>
<p>Virtual libraries in LMS are a way of creating sub-libraries of your music collection. e.g. you could have a library for each
member of your family, so they only see the artists, etc., that they care about.
</p>
<p>As per 'Browse modes' LMS usually sets the active library per-player. And with this app you can set a library for a player in
the 'Player settings' dialog. If so, then that library would restrict the tracks that some LMS features (such as 'Random mix') would
use. However, this app differs again from standard LMS by allowing the library selection to be set for this instance of the app, and
would be the same no matter which player you chose. So, for example, a family member would see their desired library no matter which
player they were currently trying to control.
</p>
<p>Please note, however, that these libraries, and the selection thereof, will not be visible until you actually create such a
library. There are various ways to do this; via saving an 'Advanced search' (click on the search icon on this app's 'Home' screen,
and then click on the 'Advanced search' icon that appears subsequently), or use plugins such as 'Simple library views.'
